# Hard_Hat_Object_Detection
The human brain is the most essential organ in the body. Injury sustained to it during accidents can lead to major malfunctions of other parts of the body, disorders, and in worst case scenarios, death. Hard hats are safety equipments in the form of helmets that are worn in an industrial environment setup for the shear purpose of protecting the head, that confines and protects the brain. These helmets have cushions provided in the space of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) between the helmet's shell and the wearer's head, so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. The hard hats are very important parts of certain industries such as construction sites, manufacturing, power plants, automobile, factories, etc. as they help in preventing or minimalizing accidents caused by fall of heavy objects, debris, electrical shock, etc. directly to the head. In such cases wearing the hard hat is indispensible to ensure safety for the workers working daily in these accident prone instances.
